"""Hard decisions written and checked by a teacher LLM (any OpenAI-compatible server, e.g. vLLM).

    python -m laya_turbo.teacher --out data/teacher/train.jsonl --docs 3000 --parallel 96 --hours 7
    python -m laya_turbo.teacher --out data/teacher/test.jsonl --docs 200 --split test --seed 1

Each document goes through two stages:
  1. author: from a random spec (family, domain, length, and per question a type and an intended
     answer), the teacher plans briefly (thinking on) and writes one realistic document with
     several typed questions about it, each hinging on a different easy-to-miss detail;
  2. solve: every question is answered twice, independently, with thinking.
One record per question. A question is kept (`"agree": true`) only when both solutions match the
intended answer; `teacher_probs` is the share of solutions choosing each option. The test split
uses domains the train split never sees. Records are appended as documents finish, and a rerun
skips documents already written. Creating <out>.stop (e.g. train.stop) pauses gracefully: no
new documents start, the ones in progress finish.

The "probability" family (only with --families probability) asks about uncertain outcomes whose
exact distribution follows from the document. The author states every option's probability,
both solutions must reproduce it (total variation <= 0.03), and `teacher_probs` is that exact
distribution, so the student learns to return it rather than a one-hot answer.

Write ONE realistic document (the "state") and SEVERAL typed questions about it. Each question must have exactly one answer that is defensible from the document alone, with no outside knowledge, and each must hinge on a different detail. Use realistic names, numbers, dates and formatting (headings, clauses, logs, emails, tables as text).

Every question must be HARD for a fast reader and still clear to a careful expert:
- Someone who matches keywords between the question and the document must pick a wrong option. The right answer needs at least two reasoning steps (for example: find the clause that applies, then its exception, then compute a date).
- Put the deciding detail away from the question's keywords: a later section, a footnote, an amendment, a table row, a follow-up message.
- Every wrong option must be backed by some surface cue in the document (a confident note, an outdated rule, a similar name, a naive calculation).
- For dates and numbers, the naive computation must give a different result than the correct one.
- Ask each question plainly. Do not point to the relevant section, clause or trap.
- Option descriptions state the outcome only, in at most 12 words. Never put reasons, evidence or clause numbers in an option.
- Option keys are short neutral labels of the outcome itself (e.g. net_45, pay_10730, escalate_to_legal). Never name a key after its role: no correct, wrong, naive, trap, tempting, actual, proper, valid, final.
